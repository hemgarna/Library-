Library Connect (BookBridge)
Overview
Library Connect is a transparent, community-driven donation platform connecting donors with local libraries in need of books and educational resources. The platform enables verified libraries to post wishlists, donors to make direct contributions, and both parties to track real-time impact through delivery confirmations and success stories.
Problem Statement
Donors lack transparent, verified ways to support rural and community libraries. Libraries struggle to publish their needs and confirm fulfilled donations. There is no centralized system for verification, tracking, and impact measurement in library donations.
Solution
At its core, Library Connect enables verified libraries to create digital wishlists of books and supplies they need. Donors can browse these wishlists, make direct contributions, and receive real-time updates on delivery and utilization. By integrating transparency, impact tracking, and storytelling, the platform builds trust between donors and recipients.
Key Features

Library Registry: Searchable directory with verified library profiles and location-based filtering
Wishlist Management: Libraries post book requests with details and vendor links (Amazon/Flipkart)
Donation Flow: Donors fulfill requests via direct purchase or fund pledges
Delivery Tracking: Coordinators upload delivery proof with photos and timestamps
Impact Updates: Donors receive confirmation and success stories via email/SMS
Admin Verification: Profile authentication, content moderation, and dispute resolution

MVP Functionality
The MVP showcases end-to-end functionality—from donor discovery to impact reporting. Libraries manage their listings through a dedicated dashboard, while administrators verify authenticity, moderate content, and resolve disputes. Each donation triggers confirmation updates and impact metrics to help donors visualize the change they create.
