Library Connect (BookBridge) is a transparent, community-driven donation platform connecting donors with local libraries in need of books and resources. It enables verified libraries to post wishlists, track donations, and share real impact stories with donors
At its core, the platform enables verified libraries to create digital wishlists of books or supplies they need. Donors can browse these wishlists, make direct contributions, and receive real-time updates on the delivery and utilization of their donations. By integrating transparency, impact tracking, and storytelling, Library Connect builds a culture of trust between donors and recipients.

The MVP showcases end-to-end functionality—from donor discovery to impact reporting. Libraries can manage their listings through a dedicated dashboard, while administrators verify authenticity, moderate content, and resolve disputes. Each donation triggers confirmation updates and impact metrics to help donors visualize the change they create.

Beyond the technical features, Library Connect embodies a scalable model for social good. Its modular design allows expansion into future cause-based verticals such as school supplies, hygiene kits, and scholarship funding. The platform is being developed with accessibility, transparency, and community engagement at its foundation.

Ultimately, Library Connect aspires to redefine digital philanthropy—turning one-time donations into ongoing community relationships. It aims to empower libraries to thrive, readers to grow, and donors to witness tangible impact through data-driven storytelling.
